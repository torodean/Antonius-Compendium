	\textbf{Preface}
\end{center}

This document is a compilation of scratch work, derivations, useful formulas, definitions, constants, and general information used for my own studies as a reference while furthering self education. It's purpose is to provide a complete 'compendium' per say of various mathematical and significant ideas used often. The idea and motivation behind it is to be a quick reference providing easily accessible access to necessary information for either double checking or recalling proper formula for use in various situations due to my own shortcomings in matters of memorization. All the material in this document was either directly copied from one of the references listed at the end or derived from scratch. On occasion \textit{typos may exist} due to human error but will be corrected when discovered.

\end{center}

This book contains formulas, definitions, and theorems that by nature are very precise. Due to this, some of the material in this book was taken directly from other sources such as but not limited to Wolfram Mathworld. This is only such in cases where a change in wording could cause ambiguities or loss of information quality.  Following this, all sources used are listed in the references section and cited when used.
