\begin{defn}[Probability]{Probability}
An exact mathematical \keyword{probability} $p$ can be defined as the asymptotic frequency of a system in state $s$ ($s \in \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is a set of all possible states of a system) by the total number of occurances of that state $N_s$ in the limit of an infinite number of trials $N$.
    \begin{align}
        p(s) = \lim_{N\rightarrow\inf}\frac{N_s}{N} \\
	p(s) \in [0,1] \forall s \in \Omega
    \end{align}
For a system with $n$ states, the total probabilities of all states must normalize to one.
    \begin{align}
        \sum_{i=0}{n}p(i) = \sum_{s \in \Omega}p(i) = \lim_{N\rightarrow\inf}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}{n}N_i = 1
    \end{align}
A \keyword{Bayesian probability} is defined as a person's knowledge of the outcome of a trial, based on the evidence at their disposal - often encompanied by an associated error. A \keyword{model probability} is an assumption or guess for the probability given the possibility of an infinite nuber of trials.
