\begin{defn}[Probability]{Probability}
An exact mathematical \textbf{probability}\index{probability} $p$ can be defined for a system in a state $s$ by the total number of occurances of that state $N_s$ in the limit of an infinite number of trials $N$.
	\begin{align}
	p(s) = \lim_{N\rightarrow\inf}\frac{N_s}{N}
	\end{align}
 For a system with $n$ states, the total probabilities of all states must normalize to one.
 	\begin{align}
  	\lim_{N\rightarrow\inf}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}{n}N_i \rightarrow 1
\end{defn}
