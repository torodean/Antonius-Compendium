\chapter{Electromagnetism}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

\keyword{Electromagnetism} is a branch of physics that deals with the study of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with charged particles and currents. It unifies two important phenomena: \keyword{electricity} and \keyword{magnetism}, which were initially considered separate until the 19th century. Key concepts and principles of electromagnetism include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \keyword{Electric Fields}: Electric fields are regions around charged particles or objects where electric forces can influence other charged particles. They are represented by vectors, indicating the direction and strength of the force experienced by a test charge placed in the field.

	\item \keyword{Magnetic Fields}: Magnetic fields arise due to moving charges or currents. They also have a vector nature and affect magnetic objects, such as magnets and magnetic materials. Magnetic fields are created in closed loops and can be visualized using field lines.

	\item \keyword{Electromagnetic Waves}: Electromagnetic waves are a form of energy propagation resulting from oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These waves do not require a medium for transmission and travel at the speed of light. Light itself is an electromagnetic wave.

	\item \keyword{Maxwell's Equations}: These are a set of four fundamental equations that form the basis of classical electromagnetism. They describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges and currents and how these fields interact with one another.

	\item \keyword{Electromagnetic Induction}: Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, leading to the generation of an electric current in a conductor. This phenomenon is the foundation of electric generators and transformers.

	\item \keyword{Electromagnetic Force}: Electric and magnetic forces are fundamental forces in nature. Charged particles experience electric forces due to their electric charges, while moving charges experience magnetic forces in the presence of magnetic fields.
\end{itemize}

Electromagnetism has extensive applications in modern technology and everyday life. It is the basis for the operation of electrical circuits, power generation, telecommunications, and numerous electrical devices. Moreover, it plays a vital role in the understanding of light and optics, electromagnetic radiation, and the behavior of charged particles in magnetic fields, making it one of the fundamental pillars of modern physics. The study of electromagnetism is crucial for advancing technology and our understanding of the natural world. 






\section{The Electromagnetic Field}

The \keyword{electromagnetic field} is a vector field that pervades all of space and consists of the components of an \keyword{electric field} and a \keyword{magnetic field}. The electromagnetic field can carry waves. The general name of these waves is \keyword{electromagnetic waves}. These oscillatory waves can have various frequencies which is one of the most important feature. The only thing that is really different from one wave to another is the frequency of oscillation. When charge is oscillated and shaken, there are different effects that occur which are all determined by the frequency. See \ref{table:em-frequencies} for some common frequencies - referred to as the \keyword{electromagnetic spectrum}. At higher frequencies, these waves behave more so like particles than actual waves, which was explained by quantum mechanics around 1920.
