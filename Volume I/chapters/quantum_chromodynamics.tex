\keyword{Quantum Chromodynamics} (QCD) is a fundamental theory in particle physics that describes the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for holding quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. QCD is a quantum field theory and is an essential component of the Standard Model, which describes the known elementary particles and their interactions. Key aspects and principles of Quantum Chromodynamics include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \keyword{Quarks} and \keyword{Gluons}: QCD postulates the existence of quarks, which are elementary particles that come in six flavors (up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom). Quarks are bound together by exchanging gluons, which are the force-carrying particles of the strong nuclear force.

	\item \keyword{Color Charge}: In QCD, quarks carry a property called "color charge," which is analogous to electric charge in electromagnetism but comes in three types: red, green, and blue (plus their corresponding anticolors). Gluons, which also carry color charge, mediate the strong force between quarks.

	\item \keyword{Asymptotic Freedom and Confinement}: QCD exhibits two remarkable phenomena. At high energies or short distances, the strong force weakens, a property known as "asymptotic freedom." This allows for precise calculations in perturbation theory. However, at low energies or long distances, the force becomes strong, and quarks are confined within hadrons, making isolated quarks inaccessible in nature.

	\item \keyword{Lattice QCD}: Because QCD becomes strongly coupled at low energies, direct calculations become challenging. Lattice QCD is a numerical approach that uses a discrete space-time lattice to perform non-perturbative calculations of QCD phenomena.

	\item \keyword{Hadronization} and \keyword{Hadron} Structure: QCD governs the process of hadronization, where quarks and gluons combine to form color-neutral hadrons (e.g., mesons and baryons). QCD also provides insights into the structure and properties of hadrons, such as their masses and decay rates.

	\item \keyword{Strong Interactions} in Particle Colliders: QCD is crucial in understanding the strong interactions observed in high-energy particle colliders, where quarks and gluons are produced in energetic collisions. The study of these interactions helps test the predictions of QCD and explore new physics.
\end{itemize}

Quantum Chromodynamics is a fundamental theory in the Standard Model, working in conjunction with Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the Electroweak Theory to describe the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions. The study of QCD has led to significant advances in our understanding of the strong force, the nature of matter, and the dynamics of quarks and gluons within hadrons. QCD is also a subject of ongoing research and remains a key area of exploration in particle physics.
