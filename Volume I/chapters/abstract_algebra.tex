\chapter{Abstract Algebra}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

Abstract algebra is a branch of mathematics focused on studying algebraic structures like groups, rings, fields, and modules. These structures generalize arithmetic and algebraic operations beyond the familiar realm of numbers, allowing for a deeper understanding of symmetry, structure, and operations in mathematics.
