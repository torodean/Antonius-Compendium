Mathematics is a systematic field of study that deals with numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. It is often regarded as the language of science, as it provides a framework for analyzing and understanding various phenomena in the natural and social world. Mathematics involves a wide range of topics, including arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, and more. It is based on rigorous logical reasoning and uses symbols and formulas to represent relationships and solve problems. Mathematics plays a crucial role in various fields, such as physics, engineering, economics, computer science, and many other disciplines, making it an essential tool for advancing knowledge and technology.

\section{Summation}

\begin{defn}[Summation Notation \label{Summation Definition}]{1}
	A sum is the result of addition. The symbol $\sum$ is used to represent the addition of a series of values. Let $..., x_{a-1}, x_a, x_{a+1}, ... ,x_{b-1}, x_b, x_{b+1}, ...$ be a fixed series $\mathbb{S}$, where each term $x_i\in\mathbb{S}$, $b, a \in \mathbb{N}$ are index values. Then the sum of values in the series from $a$ to $b$ is given by
	\begin{align}
		\sum_{i=a}^{b} x_i = x_a +  x_{a+1} + ... + x_{b-1} + x_b
	\end{align}
	In the context of summing over all of the values of a series for some index $i$, it is often written in different ways which are typically equivalent.
	\begin{align}
		\sum_{i\in\mathbb{S}} x_i \equiv \sum_{i} x_i
	\end{align}
	If the number of terms in the summation is infinite then it is called an infinite series.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Product Notation \label{Product Definition}]{1}
	A product is the result of multiplication. The symbol $\prod$ is used to represent the multiplication of a series of values. Let $..., x_{a-1}, x_a, x_{a+1}, ... ,x_{b-1}, x_b, x_{b+1}, ...$ be a fixed series $\mathbb{S}$, where each term $x_i\in\mathbb{S}$, $b, a \in \mathbb{N}$ are index values. Then the product of values in the series from $a$ to $b$ is given by
	\begin{align}
		\prod_{i=a}^{b} x_i = x_a \cdot  x_{a+1} \cdot ... \cdot x_{b-1} \cdot x_b
	\end{align}
	In the context of multiplying over all of the values of a series for some index $i$, it is often written in different ways which are typically equivalent.
	\begin{align}
		\prod_{i\in\mathbb{S}} x_i \equiv \prod_{i} x_i
	\end{align}
	If the number of terms in the summation is infinite then it is called an infinite series.
\end{defn}

%Consider a finite sum of values in a sequence $x$ from index $a$ to $b$. If we square this sum we would get
%
%\begin{align}
%	\bigg[\sum_{i=a}^{b} x_i\bigg]^2 &= (x_a +  x_{a+1} + ... + x_{b-1} + x_b)^2 \\
%	&= (x_a +  x_{a+1} + x_{a+2} + ... + x_{b-1} + x_b)(x_a +  x_{a+1} + x_{a+2} + ... + x_{b-1} + x_b) \\
%	&= \hspace{1cm} x_a^2 + 2x_ax_{a+1} + 2x_ax_{a+2} + \cdots + 2x_ax_b \nonumber\\
%	& \hspace{1cm}+ 2x_{a+1}x_{a} + x_{a+1}^2 + 2x_{a+1}x_{a+2} + \cdots + 2x_{a+1}x_b \nonumber\\
%	& \hspace{1cm}+ 2x_{a+2}x_{a} + 2x_{a+2}a_{a+1} + x_{a+2}^2 + \cdots + 2x_{a+2}x_b \nonumber\\
%	& \hspace{1.5cm} \vdots \nonumber\\
%	& \hspace{1cm}+ 2x_{b}x_{a} + 2x_{b}a_{a+1} + 2x_{b}x_{a+2} + \cdots + x_b^2	
%\end{align}
%
%From this, a pattern can be observed. There exists an $x_i^2$ term for each $i \in [a,b]$. There then exists a term $2x_ax_b$ for  all $a \neq b$. Therefore, we can write this as
%
%\begin{align}
%	\bigg[\sum_{i=a}^{b} x_i\bigg]^2 &= \sum_{i=a}^{b} x_i^2 + 2\sum_{i=a}^{b}\sum_{j=a}^{b} x_ix_j (1-\delta_{ij}),
%\end{align}
%where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta function.
%\begin{defn}[Kronecker Delta]
%	The \keyword{Kronecker delta} $\delta_{ij}$ is a discrete version of the delta function
%	\begin{align}
%		\delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
%			1, & \text{if } i = j \\
%			0, & \text{if } i \neq j \\
%		\end{cases}  \implies 1-\delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
%		0, & \text{if } i = j \\
%		1, & \text{if } i \neq j \\
%		\end{cases} \hspace{2cm}
%	\end{align}
%\end{defn}
