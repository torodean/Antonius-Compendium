Physics is the scientific study of the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter, energy, space, and time. It seeks to understand the natural world by formulating and testing mathematical models and theories based on observations and experimental evidence. Physics is a broad and diverse field that encompasses various sub-disciplines, including classical mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity, among others. Key areas of study in physics include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \keyword{Classical Mechanics}: This branch deals with the motion of macroscopic objects and is based on Newton's laws of motion and the concept of conservation of energy and momentum.

	\item \keyword{Electromagnetism}: This field explores the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with charged particles, leading to the understanding of electricity, magnetism, and electromagnetic waves.

	\item \keyword{Thermodynamics}: It examines the relationships between heat, work, and energy, providing insights into the behavior of gases, liquids, and solids and the principles of heat engines and refrigeration.

	\item \keyword{Quantum Mechanics}: This revolutionary theory describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels, often challenging our classical intuitions and introducing concepts like wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement.

	\item \keyword{Relativity}: Special and General Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, deal with the nature of space, time, and gravity, especially at high speeds and in the presence of massive objects.

	\item \keyword{Nuclear Physics}: It focuses on the study of atomic nuclei, nuclear reactions, and nuclear forces, leading to applications in energy production and understanding the universe's early moments.

	\item \keyword{Particle Physics}: This field investigates the fundamental particles of the universe and their interactions, exploring the subatomic realm with particle accelerators and detectors.

	\item \keyword{Astrophysics}: The study of celestial objects and phenomena, such as stars, galaxies, black holes, and cosmic rays, to understand the structure and evolution of the universe.

Condensed Matter Physics: It examines the properties of solid and liquid matter and studies phenomena like superconductivity, magnetism, and phase transitions.
\end{itemize}

Physics has been crucial in advancing technology and shaping our understanding of the universe, from everyday applications like electronics and telecommunications to groundbreaking discoveries about the fundamental nature of reality. It plays a central role in modern science and continues to be a driving force for innovation and progress in various fields. Physics stands as the foundational and all-encompassing science, profoundly shaping the advancement of all scientific disciplines.

\begin{interestnote}
	A poet once said, “The whole universe is in a glass of wine.” We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth’s rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe’s age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts—physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on—remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all! \cite{bib:feynman lectures}

\section{Measurement}

Measurement is one of the most important tools for studying physics as it relates to a physical reality. 

\begin{quotation}
	``Wherefore relative quantities are not the quantities themselves, whose names they bear, but those sensible measures of them (either accurate or inaccurate), which are commonly used instead of the measured quantities themselves. And if the meaning of words is to be determined [definiendae] by their use, then by the names time, space, place, and motion, their measures [mensurae sensibilies] are properly to be understood; and the expression will be unusual, and purely mathematical, if the measured quantities themselves are meant. On this account, those violate the accuracy of language, which ought to be kept precise, who interpret these words for the measured quantities. Nor do those less defile the purity of mathematical and philosophical truths, who confound real quantities with their relations and sensible measures [vulgaribus mensuris].'' \cite{bib:Newtons Scholium}
