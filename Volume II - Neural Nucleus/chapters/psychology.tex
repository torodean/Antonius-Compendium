\section{Introduction}

Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior, encompassing the processes underlying cognition, emotion, perception, and action. It explores how individuals think, feel, and behave across various contexts, integrating insights from biology, sociology, philosophy, and neuroscience. The field is broadly divided into sub-disciplines such as cognitive psychology, behavioral psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, and social psychology. Each examines different aspects of mental processes and behavior, using both experimental and observational methods.

Psychological research informs fields like education, mental health, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction, providing foundational understanding of human cognition and behavior.
