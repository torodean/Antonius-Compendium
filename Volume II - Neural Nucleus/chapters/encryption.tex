\section{Introduction}

Encryption is a fundamental technique in information security that transforms readable data, usually known as plain text, into an unreadable format, called cipher text, using a cryptographic algorithm and a key. The primary goal of encryption is to ensure confidentiality, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. There are two main types of encryption: symmetric-key encryption, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, and asymmetric-key encryption, which uses a pair of public and private keys. Encryption plays a crucial role in securing communication, data storage, and digital transactions.

















\section{d0s3 Encryption}

\subsection{Introduction and Purpose}

The d0s3 encryption algorithm is a continuation of an earlier personal encryption project originally created as part of the D3C (d0sag3\footnote{The alias d0sag3 comes from my xbox live gamer-tag from when I was younger. I used this alias to create many projects when I was first beginning to learn programming, graphic design, and other things.} command) program many years ago. The previous versions, d0s1 and d0s2, were developed during initial experimentation with C++ and served as educational implementations. This document focuses solely on the redevelopment of d0s3. Unlike its predecessors, d0s3 is intended to implement a new, more advanced encryption method capable of handling full file encryption or larger data sets in general. This section contains brainstorming, design notes, and implementation details as development resumes on the d0s3 algorithm.

The purpose of the d0s3 algorithm is to securely encrypt data in such a way that it requires an asymmetric encryption key to decrypt the data (such as a password). There are a few initial ideas and concepts which will be explored in developing this encryption algorithm, which will be explained. The algorithm must be such that any size of data can easily be encrypted in both a secure and efficient way.
